        <section class="bio">
            <p>I am a web developer and recent graduate of Thinkful's fullstack engineering program. I love web development and coding because using creativity and problem solving abilities in this capacity gives me total fulfilment and happiness. I am constantly learning and acquiring new skills within the field out of curiosity and an insatiable hunger for knowledge. </p>

            <p>I like to consider myself a well-rounded human being- spending my time away from a text editor outside playing sports, hiking, lounging on the beach while listening to anything from Young Thug to Led Zeppelin. I appreciate food and having a good conversation over a great meal. I enjoy reading all genres and playing all types of video games, but am constantly wishing I would make more time for both.</p>
